<h3> Introduction</h3>
<img src= "wfimg.png";  /img>

<p style = "color = white; font-size:20px;">Hello reader! I am Kanak Khandelwal from Jaipur, Rajasthan. I did my schooling from Saint Xavier's school, Jaipur and currently I am pursuing <abbr title = "Bachelor of Technology">B-Tech</abbr> in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kottayam(Kerela).
Talking about my hobbies, I love to play many sports like cricket, basketball, kabaddi and many more and also I love to sing, draw, learn new and different things and watch movies and documentaries. Along with that I also have a keen interest for photography and even have a photography page on instagram known as photoblaze.<br>

<p>Now, as you have learned about my hobbies, let's discuss how I acquired them and why I love them.<br>
<br>
1.) <b><u>Cricket</u></b> - &nbsp;Like majority of the Indians I am also fond of cricket. I don't exactly remember how I acquired this hobby but I think it is because of two reasons, firstly my father is also a cricket lover and secondly I saw India become the World Champions of cricket in 2011. The second one I think helped in embedding cricket in mmy heart. Even today whenever I get time I go out and play cricket with my friends(Gully cricket). Talking about my favourite cricketer, he is the one and only Mahendra Singh Dhoni.

<br> 
2.) <b><u>Basketball</u></b> - &nbsp;I used to play basketball in the games period in my school with my friends and learnt a lot about this game from them. Some of my friends were even in the school basketball team and they used to teach me the basics of the game. This is how I developed basketball as a hobby.
<br>
<br>
3.) <b><u>Kabaddi</u></b> - Though I knew how to play kabaddi before but it was only after the first season of the Pro kabaddi league that I started developing interst in the game. The main reason why I started watching kabaddi was that that my city got it's own franchise namely the Jaipur Pink Panthers which went on to win the inaugural season of <abbr title = "Pro Kabaddi League">PKL</abbr>. I love the intensity and the furiosity with which the game is played and this is the reason how I acquired it as my hobby.

<br>
4.) <b><u> Learning new things</u></b> - &nbsp;The human mind is curious and always seeks for informaton. Talking about me I love to find the answers of the questions starting with why and how and youtube is the best platform to gain knowledge in today's world. Here is a list of some youtube channels which I follow to quench the thirst of my curios mind:

<p>5.) <b><u> Watching movies</u></b> - &nbsp;I usually watch all types of movies provided the movie is content rich. Though there are many movies which I like but a movie which has a special place in my heart is the Amir Khan starrer film <i>'Taare Zameen Par'</i>. It was the first movie of my life which I went to see in a theatre and it was only because of this movie that I developed an interest in painting and drawing.
